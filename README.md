# CarlApp

CarlApp is an Open Source app that collects useful information and puts it at your finger tips!

It's built on and easily extendable app built on PhoneGap, meaning that extending it is as easy as building a website, but as powerful as full-blown app development.

Current features include:

* A detailed campus map with your current position
* A summary of your meal plan's status (Schillers, Dining Dollars, meals left this week)
* The campus calendar
